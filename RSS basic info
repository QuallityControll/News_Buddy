RSS

Really Simple syndication 

It is a type of web feed which allows users to access updates to online content in a standardized, computer-readable format

It is a way to easily distribute a list of headlines, update notices, and sometimes content to a wide number of people. Used by computer programs that organize those headlines and notices for easy reading.
 
These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. The news aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content, allowing the content to be automatically passed from website to website or from website to user. 

Subscribing to a website RSS removes the need for the user to manually check the website for new content.
